# Agentic AI Testing Architecture — Slide Deck Reference

> **Author:** Testing Architect  
> **Last Updated:** February 2026  
> **Purpose:** Detailed markdown companion to the 15-slide presentation deck on Agentic AI Testing Architecture for Automated Tool Validation

---

## Overview

This folder contains **15 detailed markdown documents**, each corresponding to one slide in the presentation deck. While the slides provide high-level visuals, these documents serve as the **architect's extended narrative** — covering the "why," "how," and "what to test" behind every layer of the platform.

## How to Use

- **Presenting:** Open the slide deck alongside these documents for deep-dive talking points
- **Interview Prep:** Walk through slides 3-13 to explain the architecture end to end
- **Team Onboarding:** Share the full folder so new architects/QAs can understand the testing philosophy
- **Architecture Review:** Use slides 11-12 metrics documents as the baseline for quality gates
